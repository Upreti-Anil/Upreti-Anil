Postdoctoral Research Fellow | Schepens Eye Research Institute, Mass Eye and Ear, Harvard Medical School

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow specializing in proliferative retinopathies, particularly the role of RUNX1 in proliferative vitreoretinopathy and retinal degeneration through multiomic approaches. My work aims to uncover molecular mechanisms to enable therapeutic advancements, contributing to innovations in biopharmaceutical treatments.

Education and Research Background

Ph.D. in Cell, Molecular, and Structural Biology, Miami University
My doctoral work focused on genomic and transcriptomic changes in fiber cell differentiation using murine models, laying a foundation for tackling complex biological challenges and translating research into impactful applications.
Leadership and Collaboration I am committed to fostering collaborative environments and have held key roles in various organizations:

Vice-President of the Golden Key International Honor Society, Miami of Ohio Chapter
Member of the Academic Program Evaluation Committee
Secretary of the Biotechnology Society of Nepal and leadership roles in academic bodies at Miami University and beyond
Technical Expertise My technical skills span several areas directly applicable to the biopharmaceutical and industrial sectors:

Bioinformatics: HISAT2, StringTie, SAMtools, IGV; skilled in R and Bash programming for next-generation sequencing analysis.
Molecular Biology: CRISPR/Cas9, PCR, RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, 10X Genomics Multiome workflows.
Animal and Cell Culture Models: Human iPSC culture, murine models, transfection, nucleofection, and explant culture.
Pharmacological Research: Expertise in solvent extraction, phytochemical analysis, and pharmacological assays for anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties.
I am eager to bridge fundamental research with practical applications, contributing to advancements in precision medicine and beyond.
